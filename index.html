        <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
        <p>After completing a degree in Law, I made the decision to transition to the tech industry, driven by my curiosity and enthusiasm for programming, AI, and cloud technologies.<br><br>
        Throughout my studies, I have developed strong technical skills in Python, C, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, with a particular focus on Python for its versatility in AI and automation. <br><br>
        In addition to my academic work, I bring valuable leadership and teamwork experience. At TU Dublin, I support and represent the university community as both a Peer Mentor and Student Ambassador, guiding first-year students, assisting with orientation, and representing the university at events such as Open Days and Careers Fairs.<br><br>
        My experience in management and costumer work in Ireland has also been sharpened by my position as a Floor Manager at The Gotham Café, where I have further developed my leadership and problem-solving skills. <br><br>
        Additionally, I serve as a facilitator for Leading Ireland’s Future Together (LIFT), organizing weekly leadership discussions and fostering collaboration within teams. <br><br>
        I am eager to continue growing through internships, projects, and collaborations that allow me to apply my knowledge and contribute to innovative solutions in the tech industry.</p>

          <h3>AI Image Classifier</h3>

          <p>I built an AI-powered web application in Python using TensorFlow (MobileNetV2), Streamlit, and OpenCV to automatically identify objects in uploaded photos. <br> The system preprocesses images for accuracy and then provides the top three predictions with confidence levels through a clean, user-friendly interface. To ensure responsiveness, I optimized the app with efficient image handling and model caching, resulting in a smooth and reliable user experience.</p>

          <h3>Library System</h3>

          <p>I developed a web-based book reservation system using PHP and MySQL, where I implemented key features such as user registration and login, as well as book search by title, author, or category. In addition, I designed and managed the reservation system while ensuring server-side validation for reliability. To improve usability, I created a clean user interface and added pagination to make navigating search results more efficient.</p>

          <h3>Crossy Road Game</h3>

          <p>As part of a team project, I developed a version of the “Crossy Road” video game using the C language. I implemented features such as game restart, high-score recording, and hardware interaction through buttons and LEDs on a breadboard system. Through this project, I demonstrated strong coding practices and thorough documentation, which resulted in achieving the highest score for code quality and comments.</p>
